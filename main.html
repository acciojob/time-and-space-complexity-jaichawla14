	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a way to measure how efficient an algorithm is by analyzing how its running time grows as the input size increases.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs during execution, and it is often expressed using Big-O notation such as O(n).
