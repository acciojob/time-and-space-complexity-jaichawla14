	<h1>Time and Space omplexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is a measure of how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to run as the size of the input increases.
It describes the growth rate of the running time relative to the input size n, rather than the exact time, and helps compare the efficiency of different algorithms.</p>
 <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the measure of how much memory space an algorithm requires for its execution, in relation to the input size n.
It expresses memory efficiency using asymptotic notations (like O(n), O(1), etc.), where for example O(n) means the memory used grows linearly with the input size.</p>
